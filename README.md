## why

I have never been loved  
do not pity me  
my heart is tough  
my soul is metal  
my mind is rough

i write this for you  
i truly do believe  
if you love me  
you will  
go through, the tunnels  
of hell and poetry  
to catch a glimpse  
of my heart

## electro

i pray in hymns  
to digital gods  
we are all unbelievers  
we all worship the internet  

the only question is  
do you pray in kilo  
or in petabytes

## odd

why am I so odd  
I ask you to love  
and then speak  
about gods  

it is simple  
even  
the moon, dances  
to the rhythm of the sky  

who am I  
not to try  
for I will never know death  
I will sleep  
when better hearts die

## cave

i am not alone  
my thoughts forever echo  
in a mental cave  
I feel chained  
but I know no cage  

will you walk with me  
will you learn to love me  
for I know not of beauty  
you cannot be ugly  
to stll be reading this far
