## why

I have never been loved  
do not pity me  
my heart is tough  
my soul is metal  
my mind is rough

i write this for you  
i truly do believe  
if you love me  
you will  
go through, the tunnels  
of hell and poetry  
to catch a glimpse  
of my heart

## electro

i pray in hymns  
to digital gods  
we are all unbelievers  
we all worship the internet  

the only question is  
do you pray in kilo  
or in petabytes
